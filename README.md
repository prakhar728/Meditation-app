# Meditation-app

This is a simple Meditation Website that I made by following Web Ed's tutorial to building one. I followed it to the end to get an idea of Vanilla Js.
The project includes a good way to use the data attribute.

## NETLIFY HOSTED
I hosted it on Netlify to give a view of how it works and what it does.
